//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step analyzes what steps and requirements will be executed to insure the software will run and operate smoothly."
const design = "This portion of the development decides what coding stacks will be best for the application, and lays the groundwork for what the application will operate like."
const implementation = "The implementation step implements the preparation laid out by the previous steps and develops the ideas into written code."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step thoroughly tests and works through problems of the written code. It will make sure the application is running smoothly and will decide how it will integrate into the software world."
const maintain = "This final step will be used throughout the application's existence, as coding and software design is rapidly changing. Developers will provide updates to the application as these changes occur."
